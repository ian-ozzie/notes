# Projects

When I initially started this vault I never intended on making it public, but after seeing how doing it with my [NixOS Configuration](projects/nixos/README.md) improved my consistency and actually got me to complete tasks instead of just starting/restarting, I'm hoping that this will do the same for my notes.

I chop and change things quite often, but lately I've actually been happy with my configuration and organisation layouts, so now I just need to actually do the work and bring it all together. I feel like I'm in control of my systems through NixOS, and coupled with [Shortcuts](projects/ios/shortcuts) on iOS I can tie into my workflows quickly, and I'm looking forward to see how I can make use of the new Pebble devices. Either way, I plan on documenting what I create here.
